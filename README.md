Data is not that of the afforemented article. Instead its and example file of ca. more or less ad hoc 1700 relevés ok iberian oak forest taken from a public data base (sivim). The computation of the modified isopam ('evopam') took circa 4 hours in an HPC computer with four Xeon Gold processors, 64 cores, 128 threads, and 1 Tb of RAM, so be careful with computation time. SO far, it was presented only in Capelo, J. & Vila-Viçosa, C.
